<h1 align="center">SNAKE GAME</h1>

### An old-school game made with Python's turtle module.
* Use arrow keys to navigate the snake and collect food.
* Avoid hitting the green border and the snake itself. Otherwise, you will lose.
* `W` `S` `A` `D` keys can be used as alternative keys to move the snake. No case-sensitivity.
  * `W` for going up.
  * `S` for going down.
  * `A` for turning right.
  * `D` for turning left.
* Press `Space` to pause the game, and to continue, press that key again.
* After the game is over, press `Enter` if you wish to restart the game and play one more round.
* The speed of the snake will increase every 10 items collected by it, be patient.
